                <p>He knows that he can’t surly fight<br>
                  The way he thinks of her at night<br>
                  When he’s alone and <br>
                  his thought at running wild<br>

                  But sometimes thoughts can get confused<br>
                  In the way that they get used<br>
                  Inside the practice <br>
                  of the thing he call his life<br>

                But Hyde keeps saying the same thing<br>
                Are we just playing are parts?<br>
                I’m either head over heals<br>
                Or head over heart<br><p>

            <p>Your TV set was on frites<br>
              and you were getting used to it<br>
              Every since, she called it quits<br>
              static line waste time and shine<br>
              So, you opened up the TV guide<br>
              look inside big brown eyes<br>
              They say she’s on at five<br>
              so keep the dial on channel nine</p>

              <p>My baby’s on channel 9<br>
              You know I thought she left<br>
              But she comes back in time<br>
              Now I get to say my goodbyes<br>
              Every Wednesday at 5<br>
              Yeah she’s a small screen star<br>
              Guess they were wrong when they say<br>
              She wont get far<br>
              Her shows moving up the charts<br>
              She plays a doctor with a broken heart<br>
              Now I get to say my goodbyes<br>
              Every Wednesday at 5<br>

              <p>you hope she keeps the radio on<br>
              cause pretty soon they’ll play this song<br>
              and she’ll come running back<br>
              So you can get her autograph<br>
              and if she still got time<br>
              You can help her run lines<br>
              Just be sure to to spoil the end<br>
              butt naked with a book and a godsend<br></p>

              <p>They say your hearts have jumped the shark<br>
              But they don’t know my favorite part<br>
              The way she moves and hits her marks<br>
              The way her story arcs<br>
              I’m not sure where that story ends but I’ve seen where ours began<br>
              So I won’t mind if the middle drags<br>
              Cuz I’m always disappointed… <br>in the third act</p>

            <p>I think, pretty sure it’s Wednesday<br>
I sit, I sit to seize the day<br>
Outside, outside is socialize<br>
Inside, inside I buy my time<br>
I am learning to be awake!<br>

I talk chit-chat the neighbor man<br>
How’s work, new wife, the weathers been<br>
Pretty good, not bad, so am I<br>
Well said, talk soon, until next time<br>
I am learning to start again!<br></p>

              <p>Think I’ll, think I’ll read a book today<br>
You know love is a funny thing<br>
Always seem to end the same<br>
But at least I’m learning<br>

Love it when a good book comes along<br>
Got a bad habit of skipping that epilogue<br>
Always seems to take so long<br>
But at least I’m learning<br>

              <p>My heart, my heart is in and out<br>
I think, I know I smell your doubt<br>
I need, I wanted everything<br>
I take you give what you can bring<br>
I am learning to be content!<br>

Stop start, stop start and hold your hand<br>
Prepare to pretend it’s nothing<br>
You wait, deep breaths and look around<br>
I run, race to think that we had found<br>
I am learning to be your friend!<br></p>
